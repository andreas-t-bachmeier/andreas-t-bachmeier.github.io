                <h2>Introducing FibulaXpand: An Innovative Solution Revolutionizing Bone Repair</h2>
                <p>With FibulaXpand, we have developed a groundbreaking approach to repair severely injured limbs, potentially saving them from amputation. Our innovative system enlarges the diameter of a bone and grows an autologous bone graft within the patient's leg, enabling a faster recovery and return to daily activities.</p>

                <h2>Vadim's Story: One Fate Among Many Others</h2>
                <p>Meet Vadim, a 21-year-old Ukrainian soldier who sustained a severe leg injury during the Russian invasion. Despite surviving, his right shinbone was shattered, leading to a severe infection. Conventional treatments suggested amputation, devastating news for someone so young.</p>
                <p>There are methods to spare him from amputation. However, for many patients like Vadim, the traditional method of bone lengthening presents significant challenges. This method requires a metal frame to be placed outside the leg fixed to the bone with wires that penetrate the skin.</p>
                <h3>The Main Drawbacks:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extended Healing Time:</strong> Vadim would need to live with the external frame for approximately two years until his bone fully heals.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Complication Risk:</strong> The metal frame significantly restricts movement and increases the risk of new infections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Daily Discomfort:</strong> The frame would prevent Vadim from wearing normal pants and force him to spend most of his time in a wheelchair.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="image-gallery">
                    <img src="Images/established.png" alt="Established Method">
                </div>
                <p>Understandably, Vadim was appalled by the prospect of this cumbersome and restrictive treatment, which would greatly impact his quality of life for an extended period.</p>
                <p>However, with the FibulaXpand technology, there is hope for Vadim to regain full use of his leg quickly.</p>

                <h2>Innovative System for Fibula Expansion</h2>
                <p>To perform the FibulaXpand procedure, a specialized system is required to expand the fibula, a non-weight-bearing bone next to the tibia in the lower leg. This system, developed exclusively by us, addresses a significant gap in current medical technology. The core of our design is a cylindrical balloon that gradually expands by introducing small amounts of liquid with a syringe through a port.</p>

                <h2>The FibulaXpand Process</h2>
                <p>Now, let us see how the expansion system is applied. As mentioned, our method known as "Fibula Expansion" leverages the body's own fibula. By expanding the fibula within the patient’s leg, we can increase its diameter allowing for the creation of a robust bone graft.</p>
                <h3>This is how it works:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> The whole system is implanted in the leg and the balloon, initially without any liquid, is inserted into the bone gap created by first halving the fibula.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bone Formation:</strong> As new bone tissue forms in the gap, similar to the healing of a broken bone, the balloon remains in place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Afterwards, over 10 days, the balloon is gradually expanded by adding liquid in several steps each day, stretching the formed bone tissue (callus) and increasing the fibula's diameter.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="image-gallery">
                    <img src="Images/2_expansionfibula.png" alt="Expansion of the Fibula">
                    <p>During the expansion a spacer is placed in the to be constructed bone gap (here in the tibia). After expansion, the fibula is resected, the spacer is removed and the graft is trimmed to the defect length and then implanted into the bone defect. Stabilization is achieved with an intramedullary nail. The reconstructed bone can heal afterwards to reach its original strength after a few months.</p>
                    <img src="Images/3_transplantation.png" alt="Transplantation of the Fibula">
                    <p>This completely internal procedure significantly reduces treatment time and complications, promoting faster and more comfortable healing in comparision to external procedures. The whole procedure, from resection of the affected avital bone segment due to infections or tumors to full reconstruction, is illustrated in the following:</p>
